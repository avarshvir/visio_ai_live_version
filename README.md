![Visio AI Logo](../Visio_AI/Visio_AI/images/homepage_img.png)

**Visio AI** is an all-in-one machine learning and data analysis application designed to provide seamless dataset uploading, data visualization, and model prediction capabilities. It is built using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, making it highly scalable and user-friendly for developers and analysts alike.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up and login functionality.
- **Data Upload**: Supports uploading CSV, Excel, and text files.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts (scatter, bar, line, etc.) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Automated imputation with options for mean, median, mode, and more.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Offers regression, classification, and clustering algorithms (e.g., decision trees, KNN, k-means).
- **Additional Tools**: Integrated tools such as a notepad, calculator, to-do list, and calendar.
  
## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for interactive UI)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask (for API integration)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: MySQL (XAMPP for local hosting)
